"""
The Dining Philosopher Problem (dining philosopher) states that n philosophers seated around a 
circular table with one chopstick between each pair of philosophers. There is one chopstick between 
each philosopher. A philosopher may eat if he can pickup the two chopsticks adjacent to him. One 
chopstick may be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not both. When a philosopher 
cannot grab both forks it sits and waits. Eating takes random time, then the philosopher puts the 
forks down and leaves the dining room. After spending some random time thinking about the nature 
of the universe, he again becomes hungry, and the circle repeats itself.
