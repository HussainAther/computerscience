There is a party to celebrate celebrities that you get to attend because you won a ticket at
your office lottery. Because of the high demand for tickets you only get to stay for one
hour but you get to pick which one since you received a special ticket. You have access
to a schedule that lists when exactly each celebrity is going to attend the party. You want
to get as many pictures with celebrities as possible to improve your social standing. This
means you wish to go for the hour when you get to hob-nob with the maximum number of
celebrities and get selfies with each of them.

We are given a list of intervals that correspond to when each celebrity comes and goes.
Assume that these intervals are , where  and  correspond to hours. That is, the
interval is closed on the left hand side and open on the right hand side. This just means
that the celebrity will be partying on and through the th hour, but will have left when the
th hour begins. So even if you arrive on dot on the th hour, you will miss this particular
celebrity.

When is the best time to attend the party? That is, which hour should you go to?

Given a list of intervals when celebrities will be at the party
Output is the time that you want to go the party when the maximum number of
celebrities are still there.
