"""
You are given an 8 Ã— 8 table of natural numbers. In any one step, you can 
either double each of the numbers in any one row, or subtract 1 from each 
of the numbers in any one column. Devise an algorithm that transforms the 
original table into a table of all zeros. What is the running time of your 
algorithm?
