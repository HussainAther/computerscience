"""
This is a game between two players. It starts with two piles of rocks, ten chips per pile. On each turn, a
player may take one chip from one pile, or two chips, one from each pile. If one pile is empty, you can
only take one chip from the other pile. The player who takes the last chip or chips wins the game.
