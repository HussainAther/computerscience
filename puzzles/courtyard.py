Consider the following tiling problem. We have a courtyard with 2n × 2n squares and we
need to tile the courtyard using L-shaped tiles or trominoes. Each trominoe consists of
three square tiles attached to form an L shape as shown below.

Can this be done without spilling over the boundaries, breaking a tromino or having
overlapping trominoes? The answer is no, simply because 2^n × 2^n = 2^2n is not divisible
by 3, only by 2. However, if there is one square that can be left untiled, then 22n – 1 is
divisible by 3. Can you show this? We, therefore, have hope of properly tiling a 2^n × 2^n
courtyard with one square that we can leave untiled because, for example, there is a statue
of your favorite President on it.

We’ll call this square that can be left untiled the missing square.

Is there an algorithm that tiles any 2^n × 2^n courtyard with one missing square in an
arbitrary location? As an example, below is a 2^3 × 2^3 where the missing square is
marked Δ. Does the location of the missing square matter?
