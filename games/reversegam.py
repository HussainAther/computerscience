Reversegam, also known as Reversi or Othello.
Reversegam has an 8×8 board and tiles that are black on one side and white on the other (our game will use Os and Xs instead).
Two players take turns placing tiles of their chosen color—black or white—on the board. When a player places a tile on the board,
any of the opponent’s tiles that are between the new tile and the other tiles of the player’s color are flipped.
