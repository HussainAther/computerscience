"""
Gray code is a form of binary encoding where transitions 
between consecutive numbers differ by only one bit. This is a 
useful encoding for reducing hardware data hazards with values 
that change rapidly and/or connect to slower hardware as inputs. 
It is also useful for generating inputs for Karnaugh maps in 
order from left to right or top to bottom.
