"""
We use the Barabasi-Albert model (BA barabasi albert) to explain power-law degree distributino
of networks by considering growth and preferential attachment. The BA algorithm in the BA model
starts with a small number m of connected nodes and, at every step, adds a new node with n<m edges
that link the new node ot m different nodes already present in the network.
