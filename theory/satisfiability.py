Satisfiability problems check whether solutions exist satisfying an interpretation of
a given Boolean formula. They have practical applications in planning and scheduling, hard and software verification,
and drug design and genetics.

    Circuit satisfiability takes an electrical Boolean circuit with a large number of inputs nad one output.
