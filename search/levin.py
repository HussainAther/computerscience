"""
The Universal Levin (levin) search lets us use the idea that we may run two algorithms
at half-speed to determine which one finishes first. We determine computational time
of algorithms by determining the logarith of the running time of a meta-algorithm
that verifies whether the output is a solution for the algorithms that it oversees.
