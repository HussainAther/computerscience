Backpropagation used for classification are part of the supervised learning
method for multilayer feed-forward artificial neural networks. Using the ways
neural cells process informaiton, we model a given function by modifying internal
weights of inputs signals to give an output signal. We use the error between output and 
a known expected output to modify the internal state.
